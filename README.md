# Multivariate Statistical Techniques Explained

This repository contains R code that explains graphically how a few different multivariate statistical techniques work. Topics covered are distance measures, principal component analysis, permutational analysis of variance, and partial least squares regression. You can check out video lectures of these techniques on YouTube.
